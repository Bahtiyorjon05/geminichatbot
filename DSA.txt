1. Social Media Feed Simulator
Description: Simulate a social media feed where users can post messages and comments. Implement a news feed that prioritizes recent posts, likes, and comments.
Data Structures: Use queues for managing the posts in a chronological order, heaps for ranking posts by popularity, and hashmaps for user profiles.
Algorithms: Implement sorting to organize posts, binary search to locate posts or comments, and hashing for quick access to users.
2. Inventory Management System
Description: Design an inventory management system for a warehouse that tracks products and their stock levels.
Data Structures: Use hashmaps to track product details (name, price, stock) and linked lists to manage inventory movement.
Algorithms: Implement binary search for searching product details, sorting algorithms to display inventory in an organized manner, and queues for processing orders.
3. Real-Time Notification System
Description: Build a real-time notification system that sends alerts to users in a timely manner.
Data Structures: Use priority queues to prioritize notifications based on urgency and hashmaps to store user preferences.
Algorithms: Implement heap-based priority queue to efficiently manage notifications with priority levels and sorting for batch delivery.
4. Job Scheduling System
Description: Create a job scheduling system where tasks with deadlines are assigned to workers. Each task has a priority, and jobs are completed before the deadline if possible.
Data Structures: Use heaps to prioritize tasks based on deadlines and queues to manage the list of jobs.
Algorithms: Implement greedy algorithms to select the best task to process next and sorting to arrange tasks by deadline.
5. Student Database Management System
Description: Build a student management system that stores student records and allows searching, updating, and deleting student data.
Data Structures: Use hashmaps to store student data and arrays or linked lists to track student records.
Algorithms: Implement binary search for fast student record lookup and sorting algorithms (merge sort, quick sort) to sort students by grades or names.
6. Online Voting System
Description: Create an online voting platform that allows users to cast votes for candidates in different categories.
Data Structures: Use arrays for storing vote counts and hashmaps for storing candidate data and voter information.
Algorithms: Implement sorting to display candidate rankings based on votes, and hashing to quickly verify if a voter has already voted.
7. Autocomplete Search Engine
Description: Build an autocomplete feature for a search engine that suggests queries based on partial input.
Data Structures: Use trie (prefix tree) to store and efficiently search for potential query suggestions.
Algorithms: Implement trie traversal for fast query suggestions and sorting to rank the suggestions by frequency or relevance.
8. Minesweeper Game Solver
Description: Develop a program that automatically solves a Minesweeper game based on the grid layout and numbers.
Data Structures: Use matrices (2D arrays) to represent the Minesweeper grid and stacks/queues for tracking the open cells.
Algorithms: Implement flood fill (BFS/DFS) for discovering safe cells and backtracking to explore potential solutions.
9. File Compression Tool (Huffman Encoding)
Description: Create a file compression tool that uses Huffman coding to compress data efficiently.
Data Structures: Use trees (Huffman tree) to build the coding structure and priority queues to efficiently generate the tree.
Algorithms: Implement Huffman encoding and decoding to compress and decompress files.
10. Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
Description: Build a visualizer for pathfinding algorithms (like A*, Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS) to help understand how these algorithms work on a grid.
Data Structures: Use graphs (nodes and edges) to represent the grid, and queues or heaps to manage the nodes to be processed.
Algorithms: Implement A algorithm*, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, BFS, and DFS for pathfinding, and visualize the step-by-step process.
